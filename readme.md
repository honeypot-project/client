# Example frontend for the [Honeypot Server](https://github.com/honeypot-project/server)

### Written in plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript

#### Note: The project was never intended to have a user-friendly frontend. The main task of the project was making the backend secure and the challenges fun.

The dashboard references to an index.php file where users could get access to the challenges.
The challenges are **not** included in this repository.
